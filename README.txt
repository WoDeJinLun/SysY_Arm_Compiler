# Compiler for SysY
1. This repo is created by ZJU undergraduate students. 
2. We intend to create a compiler for SysY(a subset of C language).
3. The front end is created using lex, yacc and common trick for C compilers.
The back end is ARM architecture oriented. 
Our ultimate goal is to compile a LINUX OS, and run these codes on the board provided by HUAWEI competition correctly :)
4. During the development, we will use some visual toolkit to visualize the result module by module.
5. Happy coding! :)

Developers: Zhang Xin, Ying Zhoujun, Yu Haoming.
